# Discover Ireland 

Discover Ireland is a website showcasing different travel destinations in Ireland where users can check each destination's description as well as its current weather.

My first React project using Routing and React Dom, creating and reusing different components. A web application that contains: 4 distinct sections of HTML5, styles controlled by several external CSS files, clearly defined, consistent, navigation system and form, information pulled from a data source.
